# ML_Classification_Regression

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to leverage classification and regression algorithms to gain insights and make predictions based on the COVID-19 dataset. This dataset contains a wide range of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including epidemiological data, healthcare infrastructure, and socioeconomic factors for various regions.

## Project Contents:

Data: This directory contains the raw dataset downloaded from Kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

Notebooks: The "notebooks" directory contains Jupyter notebooks that were created during the project. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the analysis, including data preprocessing, data visualization, classification, and regression modeling. Here's a brief overview of the notebooks:

01_data_preprocessing.ipynb: Data cleaning and feature engineering.

02_data_visualization.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

03_classification.ipynb: Classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) for tasks like identifying COVID-19 hotspots.

04_regression.ipynb: Regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forests) to predict COVID-19 cases or mortality rates.

## Results: This directory contains any saved models, visualizations, or output files generated during the project.

## Requirements: 
A list of Python packages and their versions required to run the code successfully. You can use pip install -r requirements.txt to set up your environment.

## Getting Started:

To replicate the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/iamsonuram/ML_Classification_Regression.git.

- Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

- Navigate to the "notebooks" directory and open the Jupyter notebooks in a suitable environment.

- Follow the notebooks in numerical order for a step-by-step walkthrough of the project.
