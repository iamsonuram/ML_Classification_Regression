# ML_Classification_Regression

This project focuses on the analysis of COVID-19 data using machine learning techniques for classification and regression tasks. The goal is to gain insights into the impact of various factors on the spread and severity of the virus.

## Key Objectives:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle for analysis.
Classification: Use classification algorithms to predict COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., recovery, hospitalization, mortality) based on demographic and health-related features.
Regression: Employ regression models to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in specific regions.
Data Visualization: Visualize the data and model results to aid in understanding and decision-making.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation, including a README file, to guide users through the project.

## Technologies Used:

- Python,
- Pandas,
- Scikit-Learn,
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization,
- Jupyter Notebook for code development,
- Google Colab for cloud-based computing.
